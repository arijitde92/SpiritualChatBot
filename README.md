# SpiritualChatBot
This repository is an implementation of an AI chatbot which has profound knowledge on the hindu vedic text  - "Bhagawad Gita" and acts as an avatar of Lord Vishnu who can offer you spiritual guidance straight from the holy book.
<br>
Made using [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), [Langchain](https://www.langchain.com/) and [OpenAI's](https://openai.com/) gpt-4o-mini model.
<br>
It uses conversational buffer memory and prompt templates to create proper prompts that can guide the AI chatbot into giving relevant answers to the user.
